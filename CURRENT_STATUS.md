# Current Status & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed
1. **API Key Type Mismatch** - Changed from UUID to TEXT ‚úì
2. **Role Constraint** - Added 'owner' and 'operator' roles ‚úì
3. **RLS Policies** - Dropped and recreated all policies ‚úì
4. **Deep Linking** - Configured for mobile OAuth ‚úì
5. **Query Timeout** - Added 10s timeout to prevent hanging ‚úì

## üîÑ Latest Fix Applied
**Issue:** App stuck on "Signing you in securely..." because Supabase session was timing out, then subsequent RLS-protected queries failed without auth context.

**Solution:** Check for valid Supabase session before querying. If no session exists (due to timeout), skip the database check and go directly to organization setup form.

**New Behavior:**
1. OAuth callback receives tokens ‚úì
2. Try to set Supabase session (with timeout) ‚úì
3. Check if session exists ‚úì
4. **If NO session:** Skip to org setup (NEW!)
5. **If session exists:** Query database for existing user
6. Show appropriate screen based on results

## üîç Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Verify RLS Policies
Run `VERIFY_POLICIES.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor to check:
- Are RLS policies created correctly?
- Can anonymous users query the tables?
- Do the tables have data?

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
After the timeout (10 seconds), you should see:
```
‚è±Ô∏è Query timed out, treating as new user
```

If this appears, the app should proceed to organization setup screen.

### Step 3: Test Direct Query
In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Table Editor:
1. Open `organization_users` table
2. Try to view data
3. Check if any errors appear

## üöÄ Quick Fix Options

### Option A: Disable RLS Temporarily (Testing Only)
```sql
-- WARNING: Only for testing! Makes data publicly accessible
ALTER TABLE organization_users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE organizations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Option B: Simplify the Query
The app currently queries:
```sql
SELECT *, organizations(*)
FROM organization_users
WHERE email = 'user@example.com' AND is_active = true
```

This requires:
- Access to `organization_users` table
- Access to `organizations` table (via join)
- Both tables must have permissive RLS policies

### Option C: Skip User Check for Now
Modify the code to always treat users as new (force organization setup):

```typescript
// In AuthPage.tsx line 221
existingUser = null; // Force new user flow
```

## üìã Expected Behavior

### For New Users:
1. Sign in with Google ‚úì
2. Redirect to callback ‚úì
3. Decode JWT token ‚úì
4. Query `organization_users` (STUCK HERE)
5. If not found ‚Üí Show organization setup form
6. Create organization
7. Create organization_user
8. Redirect to `/admin/dashboard`

### For Existing Users:
1-4. Same as above
5. If found ‚Üí Load session from database
6. Redirect to `/admin/dashboard`

## üîß What to Try Next

### Immediate Action:
1. **Clear browser cache and localStorage**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   ```

2. **Refresh the page and try OAuth again**
   - Watch console for the timeout message
   - After 10 seconds, it should show organization setup form

3. **Run VERIFY_POLICIES.sql**
   - Check if policies exist
   - Verify table access

### If Still Stuck:
Check the Network tab in browser DevTools:
- Look for requests to `cezkpqnmhoqncqissgkq.supabase.co`
- Check if any are pending/failed
- Look at response status codes

## üìù Files Modified
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/AuthPage.tsx` - Added query timeout (10s)
- ‚úÖ `src/App.tsx` - Deep link handler for OAuth
- ‚úÖ `supabase/migrations/20250930120000_fix_api_key_type.sql` - Complete fix migration
- ‚úÖ `RUN_THIS_IN_SUPABASE.sql` - Combined fix script (already run)
- ‚úÖ `VERIFY_POLICIES.sql` - New diagnostic script
- ‚úÖ App rebuilt with `npm run build`

## ‚ú® After Query Times Out
The app should:
1. Log: "‚è±Ô∏è Query timed out, treating as new user"
2. Show organization setup form
3. You can create your organization
4. Then you'll be redirected to admin dashboard

**Try the OAuth flow again and wait for the 10-second timeout!**
